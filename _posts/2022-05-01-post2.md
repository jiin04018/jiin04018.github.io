# Single Cell Transcriptome profiling in Gastric Cancer
Jiin Choi, Biomedical convergence science & technology, Kyungpook National University(KNU), Daegu, Korea

Abstract : Gastric cancer is a highly threatening disease with the worldâ€™s fifth largest incidence and third largest mortality rate.
There are many studies about transcriptome analysis of Gastric cancer, but these studies were implemented at tissue levels. Technology 
of single cell RNA seq has been developed rapidly, analyzing transcriptome at the single cell level is being applied efficiently to 
determine the genetic characteristics of tumor. Here, we investigated gastric cancer, gastric adenoma, and normal gastric tissues at 
the single cell level by using 10X chromium method. This analysis would detect prognostic biomarkers and identify the complex genetic
heterogeneity of Gastric cancer
