# Analysis of Various Brain Tumor Transcriptome with Immune Expression and Cell Types

Abstract : Brain tumor is a dangerous disease to human and there are many different types of brain tumors.
Because immunotherapy is being effeciently applied as a treatment for these brain tumors, uncovering immune
expression in brain TME(Tumor Microenvironment) could help advance these therapies. Also There are diverse 
cell types that interrupt the immune system in TME, revealing the heterogeneity of the TME may help develop
therapeutics for brain tumors. This study will use public microarray and single cell RNA sequencing databases
to analysis immune expression and cellular heterogeneity about various brain tumor. It will help to develop
a treatment for each brain tumor and contribute to realize future precision medicine
